Inheritance is a classes ability to inherit the protected properties of a parent class so that the sub class can use these inherited methods.
Polymorphism is a classes ability to process objects of many different types based on class or data type.
Encapsulation is the idea of protecting a program from being misused. Hiding data and lower level details is important when writing good software.

The role game uses Encapsulation in order to provide a consistent and stable game for the end developer. Protection levels ensure this standard is maintained within the program.

The game also is an example of polymorphism as should by the simulateweapon. You pass an argument into the function and will be able to derive a variety of subclasses.
